00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
 hey econ students this is Jacob Clifford

2
00:00:01,819 --> 00:00:03,899
 

3
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:04,980
 welcome to ac/dc econ so in this quick

4
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:04,980
 

5
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,259
 video I'm gonna cover everything you

6
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:07,259
 

7
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,719
 need for an introductory macroeconomics

8
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,719
 

9
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,400
 class or an AP macroeconomics class I'm

10
00:00:09,709 --> 00:00:11,400
 

11
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,780
 gonna go super fast but keep in mind

12
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,780
 

13
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,429
 this is not designed to reteach you all

14
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,429
 

15
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,350
 the concepts it's designed to help you

16
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:16,350
 

17
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,570
 get ready right before you walk into the

18
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:18,570
 

19
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,010
 big AP test your big final also it's a

20
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,010
 

21
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,570
 great way to review what you know and

22
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,570
 

23
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,550
 don't know by watching the entire class

24
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,550
 

25
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,050
 over again you can spot the things that

26
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,050
 

27
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:26,550
 you have to go back instead if you've

28
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,550
 

29
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:27,840
 been watching my videos you know I sell

30
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,840
 

31
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,830
 something called the ultimate review

32
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,830
 

33
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,050
 pack it has a bunch of practice

34
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,050
 

35
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,790
 questions and access to hidden videos to

36
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,790
 

37
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,649
 help you learn economics these summary

38
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,649
 

39
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,030
 videos they cover everything in greater

40
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:36,030
 

41
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:37,680
 detail than this video I'm doing right

42
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,680
 

43
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,149
 now now I was gonna make this video

44
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,149
 

45
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,890
 available only to people who buy the

46
00:00:39,139 --> 00:00:40,890
 

47
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,079
 packet but then I thought you know I can

48
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,079
 

49
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,520
 trust people man if you like my videos

50
00:00:43,069 --> 00:00:44,520
 

51
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:46,469
 if these videos help you learn economics

52
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,469
 

53
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,390
 please go get the packet I'm gonna make

54
00:00:46,459 --> 00:00:48,390
 

55
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,309
 this video available to everyone but if

56
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,309
 

57
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,660
 you like my stuff please support my

58
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,660
 

59
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,059
 channel and help me continue to make

60
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:54,059
 

61
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,289
 great econ videos okay let's start it up

62
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:55,289
 

63
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:57,390
 now whether or not you're enrolled in a

64
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:57,390
 

65
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,460
 microeconomics class or a macroeconomics

66
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,460
 

67
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,379
 class it all starts the same for a basic

68
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,379
 

69
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,090
 introductory econ course it's starting

70
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:03,090
 

71
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,650
 the idea of scarcity scarcity ideas we

72
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,650
 

73
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,479
 have unlimited wants and limited

74
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,479
 

75
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,189
 resources also you learn the idea of

76
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:08,189
 

77
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,689
 opportunity costs that's the idea that

78
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:09,689
 

79
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:10,890
 everything has a cost or it doesn't

80
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:10,890
 

81
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,939
 matter what you're producing you gotta

82
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,939
 

83
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,500
 give up something to produce or any

84
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:13,500
 

85
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,150
 decision you make has a cost

86
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,150
 

87
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,799
 now those concepts come together with

88
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,799
 

89
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,930
 the production possibilities curve it's

90
00:01:16,789 --> 00:01:18,930
 

91
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,850
 the first graph you learn in economics

92
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,850
 

93
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,799
 it shows the different combinations of

94
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,799
 

95
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,540
 producing two different goods using all

96
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:24,540
 

97
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,430
 of your resources so any point on the

98
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:26,430
 

99
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:28,080
 curve is efficient like you're using all

100
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,080
 

101
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,640
 of your resources to the fullest any

102
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:29,640
 

103
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,950
 point inside the curve is inefficient

104
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,950
 

105
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,540
 and a point out here outside the curve

106
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,540
 

107
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,860
 is impossible given your current

108
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,860
 

109
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,000
 resources and there's two different

110
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,000
 

111
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,439
 shapes you have to remember if it's a

112
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,439
 

113
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,030
 straight line production possibilities

114
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:39,030
 

115
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,710
 curve that means there's constant

116
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,710
 

117
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,909
 opportunity costs which means the

118
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,909
 

119
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,520
 resources to produce the different

120
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,520
 

121
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,110
 products are very similar so similar

122
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,110
 

123
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,000
 resources if it's a straight line if

124
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,000
 

125
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,130
 it's a boat outline concave to the

126
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,130
 

127
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,720
 origin that means that resources are not

128
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,720
 

129
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,549
 very similar so when you produce more of

130
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,549
 

131
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,780
 one to give the more and more of the

132
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,780
 

133
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:56,430
 other one that's called the law of

134
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,430
 

135
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,750
 increasing opportunity cost now this

136
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,750
 

137
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,909
 curve can shift if you have more

138
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,909
 

139
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,100
 resources like land labor and capital or

140
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:02,100
 

141
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,659
 less resources or better technology that

142
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,659
 

143
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,460
 can shift the curve another thing that

144
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:05,460
 

145
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,649
 shifts a curve is train if another

146
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,649
 

147
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,970
 country trades with another country that

148
00:02:07,639 --> 00:02:08,970
 

149
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:10,530
 can shift out their production

150
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,530
 

151
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,700
 possibilities curve but it shows how

152
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,700
 

153
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,959
 much they can consume not actually

154
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,959
 

155
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,890
 produced so it doesn't actually change

156
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:13,890
 

157
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,440
 how much you can

158
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,440
 

159
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,819
 but you can consume beyond your

160
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,819
 

161
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,050
 production possibilities curve and that

162
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,050
 

163
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,519
 brings us to the hardest part of this

164
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,519
 

165
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,319
 unit the idea of comparative advantage

166
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,319
 

167
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,360
 compared advantage is the idea that

168
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:24,360
 

169
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,800
 country should specialize in the product

170
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,800
 

171
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,510
 where they have a lower opportunity cost

172
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,510
 

173
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,069
 so if you're producing one thing and I'm

174
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,069
 

175
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,269
 producing something else if I can

176
00:02:29,059 --> 00:02:30,269
 

177
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,190
 produce a lower opportunity cost than

178
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:32,190
 

179
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:33,390
 you I should produce this you should

180
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,390
 

181
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,650
 present a thing and then we should trade

182
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,650
 

183
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,910
 now there's two different things gotta

184
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,910
 

185
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,650
 remember absolute advantage and

186
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,650
 

187
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,510
 comparative and absolute advantage is a

188
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,510
 

189
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,799
 joke it's easy you just figure out who

190
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,799
 

191
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,660
 produces more if that means they have an

192
00:02:40,789 --> 00:02:42,660
 

193
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,430
 absolute advantage compared advantage

194
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,430
 

195
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,599
 requires you do some calculations or the

196
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,599
 

197
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,340
 quick and dirty if you saw my unit

198
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,340
 

199
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,110
 summary video and it tells you who

200
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,110
 

201
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,190
 should specialize in what now another

202
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,190
 

203
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,810
 thing you have to learn is that you have

204
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,810
 

205
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,030
 terms of trade which means how many

206
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,030
 

207
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:55,380
 units of one product should they trade

208
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,380
 

209
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,760
 for the other product that wouldn't

210
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,760
 

211
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,379
 benefit both countries that's the idea

212
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,379
 

213
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,579
 of terms of trade in this unit you also

214
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,579
 

215
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:01,410
 get a basic overview of different

216
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:01,410
 

217
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:03,120
 economic systems like the free market

218
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
 

219
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:05,129
 system capitalism and the idea of a

220
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,129
 

221
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,530
 command economy and a mixed economy

222
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,530
 

223
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:09,120
 we're gonna focus on capitalism in this

224
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,120
 

225
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,370
 class and so you learn the circular flow

226
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,370
 

227
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,260
 model the circular flow model shows you

228
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,260
 

229
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,030
 that there's businesses and individuals

230
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:15,030
 

231
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,980
 and the government and how they interact

232
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,980
 

233
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,519
 with each other just remember businesses

234
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,519
 

235
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:22,470
 both sell and buy two different things

236
00:03:20,509 --> 00:03:22,470
 

237
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:24,120
 they sell products and they buy

238
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,120
 

239
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:25,709
 resources so there's a product market

240
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,709
 

241
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,040
 and there's a resource market and

242
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,040
 

243
00:03:25,709 --> 00:03:30,900
 individuals you and me we buy products

244
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,900
 

245
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,010
 and we sell our resources and the

246
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:32,010
 

247
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,940
 government does some stuff as well

248
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,940
 

249
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,739
 another thing you're going to learn here

250
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,739
 

251
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,150
 is some vocab like transfer payments

252
00:03:34,729 --> 00:03:36,150
 

253
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,859
 this is when the government pays

254
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,859
 

255
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,630
 individuals like welfare but it's not to

256
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,630
 

257
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:41,670
 buy anything it's just to provide some

258
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,670
 

259
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,989
 public service and you also learn the

260
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,989
 

261
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:45,209
 idea of subsidies when the government

262
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,209
 

263
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,010
 provides businesses money to produce

264
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,010
 

265
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,329
 more and also you're going to talk about

266
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,329
 

267
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,340
 the idea of factor payments so

268
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,340
 

269
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,739
 individuals sell their resources and

270
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,739
 

271
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,359
 businesses pay the factor payments to

272
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:54,359
 

273
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,440
 those individuals unit one sets the

274
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:55,440
 

275
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:57,120
 foundation for everything you're gonna

276
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,120
 

277
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:58,739
 be doing later on you start with demand

278
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,739
 

279
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,180
 and supply remember the man is a

280
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,180
 

281
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,950
 downward sloping curve that shows you

282
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,950
 

283
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,569
 the loved man when price goes up people

284
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,569
 

285
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,709
 buy less and stuff right when price goes

286
00:04:03,559 --> 00:04:04,709
 

287
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:06,569
 down people buy more that's the idea

288
00:04:04,699 --> 00:04:06,569
 

289
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,220
 price and quantity demanded there's also

290
00:04:06,559 --> 00:04:08,220
 

291
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,840
 a lot of supply when the price goes up

292
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,840
 

293
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,549
 people produce more price goes down

294
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,549
 

295
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,590
 people produce less right price goes up

296
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:13,590
 

297
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:15,239
 quantity supply goes up price goes down

298
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,239
 

299
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,639
 client supply goes down now together

300
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:17,639
 

301
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,889
 they formed equilibrium please note if

302
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,889
 

303
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,510
 price goes up there is no shift price

304
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,510
 

305
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:23,159
 does not shift the curve it just moves

306
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,159
 

307
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,990
 along the curve creates either shortage

308
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,990
 

309
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:26,159
 when the price is low or a surplus from

310
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,159
 

311
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,120
 the price is higher you should also

312
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,120
 

313
00:04:26,159 --> 00:04:28,710
 understand

314
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,710
 

315
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,940
 there's actual individual shifts so

316
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,940
 

317
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,790
 there's only four things gonna happen

318
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,790
 

319
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:34,770
 the man can go up the man can go down so

320
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,770
 

321
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,419
 pi can go up or a supply can go down and

322
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,419
 

323
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,070
 you just watch the graph draw the graph

324
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,070
 

325
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:39,360
 tells you exactly happens the price in

326
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,360
 

327
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,919
 quantity every single time now to

328
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,919
 

329
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,419
 microeconomics class you got a lot more

330
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,419
 

331
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,100
 details about the supply and demand

332
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:44,100
 

333
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,780
 graph and ceilings and floors and all

334
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,780
 

335
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,550
 sorts of crazy other stuff but you don't

336
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,550
 

337
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:49,470
 need to understand those concepts for

338
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,470
 

339
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,240
 most macroeconomics classes just

340
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,240
 

341
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,370
 understand where equilibrium comes from

342
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,370
 

343
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,169
 what happens when demand shifts right or

344
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,169
 

345
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,449
 left when supply shifts left or right

346
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:57,449
 

347
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,310
 and understand the idea of shortage and

348
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,310
 

349
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,570
 surplus that's usually enough and you

350
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,570
 

351
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,560
 add on to that concept when you learn

352
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
 

353
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,289
 about a great demand

354
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,289
 

355
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,630
 agar supply later on in unit 3 overall I

356
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,630
 

357
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:08,490
 give unit one five out of ten difficulty

358
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,490
 

359
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,260
 not because it's super hard because

360
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,260
 

361
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:11,699
 there's a lot of stuff you got a cover

362
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,699
 

363
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,300
 production possibilities curve supply

364
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:12,300
 

365
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,770
 and demand

366
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,770
 

367
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,389
 understand all these different graphs

368
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,389
 

369
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,010
 and it's gonna set the foundation for

370
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,010
 

371
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,270
 everything you do in the rest of the

372
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,270
 

373
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,010
 course here we go now we're going to

374
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,010
 

375
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,110
 jump into full macroeconomics we talk

376
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,110
 

377
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,669
 about the macro measures in unit two

378
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,669
 

379
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:25,080
 were talking about the three goals of

380
00:05:23,659 --> 00:05:25,080
 

381
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:27,030
 every economy doesn't matter what kind

382
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:27,030
 

383
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,470
 of economy is they have three goals they

384
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,470
 

385
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,880
 want to grow over time they want to

386
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,880
 

387
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,470
 produce more stuff they want to keep

388
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,470
 

389
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,639
 unemployment down like limit

390
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,639
 

391
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,220
 unemployment they want to limit

392
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:34,220
 

393
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,120
 inflation or at least keep prices stable

394
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,120
 

395
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,680
 that's what you do in the student you

396
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,680
 

397
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,150
 cover each one of these concepts how do

398
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,150
 

399
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,560
 you measure these different things and

400
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,560
 

401
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,389
 one of the issues with those

402
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,389
 

403
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,220
 measurements and then we move on and ply

404
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:44,220
 

405
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:46,410
 that stuff in later units so it starts

406
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,410
 

407
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,970
 off with the idea of growth growth is

408
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,970
 

409
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,620
 the idea the economy's expanding over

410
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,620
 

411
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:51,570
 time and the most important concept

412
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,570
 

413
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:54,180
 probably in the entire course is GDP

414
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,180
 

415
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,220
 gross domestic product it's the dollar

416
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,220
 

417
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,770
 value of all final goods produce in a

418
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,770
 

419
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,840
 year in a country's border so anything

420
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,840
 

421
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,430
 you produce in your own country now you

422
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,430
 

423
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,260
 should also understand the idea of GDP

424
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,260
 

425
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,960
 per capita which is the GDP divided by

426
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,960
 

427
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,760
 population and get good at doing percent

428
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,760
 

429
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,169
 change so if I say the GDP in one year

430
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,169
 

431
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,550
 is this amount in the GDP in another

432
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,550
 

433
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,810
 year it's different amounts you should

434
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,810
 

435
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,270
 be able to calculate the percent change

436
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,270
 

437
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,010
 in the GDP and when it comes to GDP it's

438
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,010
 

439
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,389
 important to know it's not included in

440
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,389
 

441
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,430
 GDP and the first one is intermediate

442
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,430
 

443
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:22,680
 goods these are goods that go into the

444
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,680
 

445
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,510
 production of a final good so we only

446
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,510
 

447
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,130
 count the final good not the things that

448
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,130
 

449
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:28,650
 went into producing it so we count the

450
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,650
 

451
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,050
 final laptop not the computer chip that

452
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,050
 

453
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,789
 the laptop producer bought from another

454
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,789
 

455
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,070
 company so intermediate goods don't

456
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,070
 

457
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,409
 count also we don't count non production

458
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,409
 

459
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:39,360
 transactions these are situations where

460
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:39,360
 

461
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,189
 newest producer stocks and bonds they

462
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,189
 

463
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,409
 don't count in GDP because we have to

464
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,409
 

465
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:45,479
 count things that are goods and services

466
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:45,479
 

467
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:47,759
 provided in that year nothing old

468
00:06:45,469 --> 00:06:47,759
 

469
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,589
 nothing counted in previous years that

470
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,589
 

471
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,349
 doesn't count towards GDP and the last

472
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,349
 

473
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:54,689
 one is non market transaction so illegal

474
00:06:52,339 --> 00:06:54,689
 

475
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:56,219
 goods or illegal labor those don't count

476
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,219
 

477
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,659
 in GDP either there's two ways to

478
00:06:56,209 --> 00:06:57,659
 

479
00:06:56,219 --> 00:06:58,919
 calculate GDP even though the most

480
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:58,919
 

481
00:06:57,659 --> 00:07:00,839
 important one for our purposes is

482
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,839
 

483
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,939
 usually the expenditures approach but

484
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,939
 

485
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:04,619
 there's also the into approach the

486
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,619
 

487
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,779
 expenditure approach adds up all the

488
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:06,779
 

489
00:07:04,619 --> 00:07:08,339
 spending on all goods and services in

490
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,339
 

491
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:10,589
 the economy and that tells you how much

492
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:10,589
 

493
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:12,539
 we produce in a given year the income

494
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:12,539
 

495
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,519
 approach adds up all the income earned

496
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,519
 

497
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,929
 from producing those final goods and

498
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:15,929
 

499
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,399
 services so really it should just be the

500
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,399
 

501
00:07:15,929 --> 00:07:19,050
 same number two different ways of

502
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:19,050
 

503
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:21,269
 calculating it but it does give us the

504
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,269
 

505
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,569
 most important equations remember GDP

506
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,569
 

507
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:26,699
 equals C plus I plus G + xn the super

508
00:07:24,559 --> 00:07:26,699
 

509
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,469
 important concept remember business

510
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:28,469
 

511
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,059
 spending is investment it's not stocks

512
00:07:28,459 --> 00:07:30,059
 

513
00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:31,860
 and bonds stocks and bonds don't count

514
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,860
 

515
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:33,419
 towards GDP government spending

516
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,419
 

517
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,339
 government can buy stuff and other

518
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,339
 

519
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,159
 countries can buy stuff now for net

520
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:38,159
 

521
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:39,689
 exports remember exports - imports is

522
00:07:38,149 --> 00:07:39,689
 

523
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,069
 the net exports in three united states

524
00:07:39,679 --> 00:07:41,069
 

525
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,689
 actually a negative number and the

526
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,689
 

527
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:45,329
 income approach also has its own

528
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:45,329
 

529
00:07:42,689 --> 00:07:47,339
 equation it's made up of rent wages

530
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,339
 

531
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:49,679
 interest and profits so if you add up

532
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:49,679
 

533
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:51,809
 all those you adds up what's called the

534
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:51,809
 

535
00:07:49,679 --> 00:07:53,610
 factor payments then that should add up

536
00:07:51,799 --> 00:07:53,610
 

537
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:55,019
 to the GDP of the things we produce in a

538
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,019
 

539
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,550
 year another concept you're gonna see is

540
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,550
 

541
00:07:55,019 --> 00:07:59,069
 the idea of nominal and real GDP

542
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,069
 

543
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,360
 remember nominal GDP is not adjusted for

544
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:00,360
 

545
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:02,579
 inflation so when we talk about the

546
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,579
 

547
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,199
 economy we're usually analyzing real GDP

548
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,199
 

549
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:05,249
 because that's suggesting for inflation

550
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,249
 

551
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,959
 and showing us what we're actually

552
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,959
 

553
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:09,059
 producing and a great way to show that

554
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:09,059
 

555
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,739
 is the business cycle the business cycle

556
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,739
 

557
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,360
 shows you there's four different phases

558
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,360
 

559
00:08:10,739 --> 00:08:14,069
 in the business cycle when there's a

560
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,069
 

561
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,289
 peak and then when the economy is up

562
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,289
 

563
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:18,089
 there eventually over time the economy

564
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,089
 

565
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,499
 moves towards a recession and it falls

566
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:19,499
 

567
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,269
 down to a trough and then it goes into

568
00:08:19,489 --> 00:08:21,269
 

569
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,610
 expansion and goes right back up economy

570
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:23,610
 

571
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,589
 goes up and down over time and that

572
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,589
 

573
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,419
 tells you there's only three places the

574
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,419
 

575
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:29,189
 economy can be at any given period of

576
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,189
 

577
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:30,629
 time we can be at full employment this

578
00:08:29,179 --> 00:08:30,629
 

579
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:33,930
 the idea that the country is doing great

580
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:33,930
 

581
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:36,240
 GP is real GP is moving nice and steady

582
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,240
 

583
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,159
 we can have a recession right this is a

584
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,159
 

585
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,120
 no recessionary gap or the economy is

586
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,120
 

587
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,680
 not doing well we have very high

588
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,680
 

589
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,329
 unemployment and we have something

590
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:42,329
 

591
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,740
 called an inflationary gap when the

592
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:43,740
 

593
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:45,180
 economy is kind of overheating and we're

594
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,180
 

595
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,980
 having more and more inflation you're

596
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,980
 

597
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,630
 gonna see those concepts later on as

598
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,630
 

599
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,590
 well and that leads to the second goal

600
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,590
 

601
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,690
 of every economy to limit unemployment

602
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,690
 

603
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,550
 unemployment is the idea people who are

604
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,550
 

605
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,810
 looking for work that can't find it who

606
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,810
 

607
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,670
 are in the labor force remember it's not

608
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,670
 

609
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:59,650
 by population it's the number of people

610
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,650
 

611
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:01,720
 who are not working who are actively

612
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,720
 

613
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:03,610
 looking divided by the labor force times

614
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,610
 

615
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,020
 100 gives you percentage that percentage

616
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,020
 

617
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,790
 number people who are unemployed in the

618
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,790
 

619
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,410
 economy there's also the labor force

620
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,410
 

621
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,970
 participation rate and understand the

622
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,970
 

623
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:11,890
 idea of labor force is the group of

624
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,890
 

625
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,990
 people who can and are able and are

626
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,990
 

627
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:15,910
 willing to work above 16 not

628
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,910
 

629
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,170
 institutionalize not in jail and at this

630
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,170
 

631
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,670
 point you're to learn that's three types

632
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,670
 

633
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,230
 of unemployment there's frictional when

634
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,230
 

635
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,090
 people are between jobs and they're

636
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,090
 

637
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:23,830
 looking for jobs they're structural when

638
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,830
 

639
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,820
 people are replaced by robots or they

640
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,820
 

641
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,250
 don't have the skills that people

642
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,250
 

643
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,630
 actually want or that employers want so

644
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,630
 

645
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,310
 their skills are obsolete and they're

646
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,310
 

647
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,050
 cyclical unemployment when there's a

648
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,050
 

649
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:33,790
 recession that kind of has gone down and

650
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,790
 

651
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,200
 people have lost a job because no one's

652
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,200
 

653
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,750
 buying products so people don't need

654
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,750
 

655
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,000
 resources they don't need the workers so

656
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,000
 

657
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,710
 anytime in the economy whether it's good

658
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,710
 

659
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,180
 or bad there's always gonna be two types

660
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,180
 

661
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,710
 of unemployment frictional and

662
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,710
 

663
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,300
 structural and that's the goal remember

664
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,300
 

665
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,730
 the goal is not to have 0% unemployment

666
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,730
 

667
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,380
 the goal is to have just frictional and

668
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,380
 

669
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,400
 structural unemployment so in United

670
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,400
 

671
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,260
 States that's about you know five

672
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:53,260
 

673
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,330
 percent unemployment that's called the

674
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,330
 

675
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,220
 natural rate of unemployment it's

676
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,220
 

677
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,600
 perfectly great to have only frictional

678
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,600
 

679
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,830
 and structural unemployment if the

680
00:09:58,590 --> 00:09:59,830
 

681
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,450
 economy is doing poorly we have a

682
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,450
 

683
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,470
 recessionary gap when we also have

684
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,470
 

685
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:06,730
 cyclical unemployment and of course the

686
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,730
 

687
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,560
 unemployment rate also has some

688
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,560
 

689
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,240
 criticisms keep in mind that sometimes

690
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,240
 

691
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,470
 people aren't counted when they should

692
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,470
 

693
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,940
 be kind of it's called discouraged

694
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,940
 

695
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,040
 workers these are people who stopped

696
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,040
 

697
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,940
 looking for work and they're not counted

698
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,940
 

699
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,470
 in the labor force they're not

700
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,470
 

701
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,870
 considered unemployed but in real life

702
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,870
 

703
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,280
 like they are they wish they had job but

704
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,280
 

705
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:23,140
 they stopped looking we stop looking

706
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,140
 

707
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:25,390
 you're not part of labor force so that

708
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:25,390
 

709
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:26,770
 one makes the unemployment rate look

710
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,770
 

711
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:28,000
 lower than it actually should be and

712
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,000
 

713
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:29,980
 there's also the idea of part-time

714
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,980
 

715
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,080
 workers pipeline workers are counted as

716
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:32,080
 

717
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,730
 fully employed and so somebody might be

718
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,730
 

719
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,190
 all upset and sad that they're not

720
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,190
 

721
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:37,540
 working full-time but according to the

722
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,540
 

723
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:39,370
 numbers they're still considered fully

724
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,370
 

725
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,960
 employed and again the unemployment rate

726
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
 

727
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:42,190
 number is that perfect doesn't show

728
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,190
 

729
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,600
 actually what's happening in all

730
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,600
 

731
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:45,670
 situations in the economy and there's

732
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,670
 

733
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
 one more goal of every economy to keep

734
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,920
 

735
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,720
 prices stable to limit crazy inflation

736
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,720
 

737
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,090
 remember inflation is the idea that

738
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,090
 

739
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,740
 money loses its purchasing power right

740
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,740
 

741
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:55,600
 so it requires more money to buy the

742
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,600
 

743
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,400
 same number of goods as before when

744
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,400
 

745
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,230
 there's more inflation we have inflation

746
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,230
 

747
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,150
 there's also deflation when prices are

748
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,150
 

749
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,100
 falling and this inflation wins the

750
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,100
 

751
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,150
 economy or sorry when the inflation

752
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,150
 

753
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,480
 rates actually falling so inflation

754
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,480
 

755
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,010
 rates

756
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,010
 

757
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,510
 going up for a long time and the

758
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,510
 

759
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:10,089
 inflation rates going up by less and

760
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,089
 

761
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:11,740
 less that's called this inflation you

762
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,740
 

763
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:13,839
 should understand the idea of nominal

764
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,839
 

765
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,550
 and real wages if you know let's say

766
00:11:13,829 --> 00:11:15,550
 

767
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,449
 your boss gave you a five percent raise

768
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,449
 

769
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:19,630
 yeah great

770
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,630
 

771
00:11:16,449 --> 00:11:21,639
 my nominal wage increase my nominal wage

772
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,639
 

773
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:24,339
 went up by five percent but if you have

774
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:24,339
 

775
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,769
 ten percent inflation than in real life

776
00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:26,769
 

777
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:28,420
 your real wage fell by five percent so

778
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:28,420
 

779
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,920
 you have to understand the idea that you

780
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,920
 

781
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,560
 know nominal is just looking at the

782
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,560
 

783
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,180
 regular numbers and then real adjust for

784
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,180
 

785
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,800
 inflation it's the same thing with

786
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,800
 

787
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,870
 interest rates if inflation goes up

788
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,870
 

789
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,430
 that's going to decrease the real

790
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,430
 

791
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:41,560
 interest rate right that's the idea of

792
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,560
 

793
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,010
 you know unexpected inflation which

794
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,010
 

795
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,320
 hurts

796
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
 

797
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:46,630
 lenders unexpected inflation hurts

798
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,630
 

799
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,680
 lenders it helps borrowers another

800
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,680
 

801
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,480
 country we have to understand is the

802
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,480
 

803
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,040
 idea of CPI it's the Consumer Price

804
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,040
 

805
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,420
 Index it's the best way and the most

806
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,420
 

807
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,860
 popular way we show it of measure you

808
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,860
 

809
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,110
 know prices changes over time and

810
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,110
 

811
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,519
 inflation basically it's a market basket

812
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,519
 

813
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:59,649
 that we can analyze and there's an

814
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,649
 

815
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,850
 equation you got to know the market

816
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:00,850
 

817
00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:03,040
 basket of the year you're looking for

818
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
 

819
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,410
 the value of the goods that we analyze

820
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,410
 

821
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,079
 and track the market basket divided by

822
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,079
 

823
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,420
 that same goods and same stuff in a base

824
00:12:08,069 --> 00:12:10,420
 

825
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,310
 year so what was the value is that price

826
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,310
 

827
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,110
 of all that stuff in the base year times

828
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,110
 

829
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,810
 100 and it pops at a number and that

830
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,810
 

831
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:18,550
 number tells you how prices have changed

832
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,550
 

833
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:21,730
 since the base year so if you see a 120

834
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,730
 

835
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,920
 prices went up 20% since the base here

836
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,920
 

837
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:26,380
 if you see a 200 prices went up 100%

838
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,380
 

839
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,019
 since the base year you see it 95 that

840
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,019
 

841
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:30,370
 means prices fell 5% since the base year

842
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:30,370
 

843
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,810
 probably one of the hardest concepts in

844
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,810
 

845
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,850
 this unit is the idea of the deflator

846
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,850
 

847
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,769
 the deflator conceptually is really easy

848
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,769
 

849
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:37,300
 it's like the CPI except it analyzes

850
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,300
 

851
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:40,139
 everything so instead of just consumer

852
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,139
 

853
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:42,730
 goods it's analyzing you know steel and

854
00:12:40,129 --> 00:12:42,730
 

855
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:44,440
 concrete and other things that consumers

856
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,440
 

857
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,120
 don't really buy but the business would

858
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,120
 

859
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,649
 buy the government buys and it looks at

860
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,649
 

861
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,170
 the prices of everything in the economy

862
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:50,170
 

863
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:53,110
 so the deflator deflates the nominal GDP

864
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,110
 

865
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:55,240
 the equations right here the GDP

866
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,240
 

867
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:57,250
 deflator is the nominal GDP divided by

868
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,250
 

869
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,360
 the real GDP times 100 again it's a

870
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,360
 

871
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,670
 number it's an index number that tells

872
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,670
 

873
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,199
 you how prices changed relative to some

874
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,199
 

875
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,209
 base year you definitely wanna do some

876
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:04,209
 

877
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,649
 calculation and some practice on doing

878
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:05,649
 

879
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,209
 the deflator and the last concept you're

880
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,209
 

881
00:13:05,649 --> 00:13:09,519
 gonna learn in this unit is the causes

882
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,519
 

883
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:10,690
 of inflation inflation happens for three

884
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:10,690
 

885
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,829
 reasons the first one is when a

886
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,829
 

887
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:13,240
 government just prints too much money

888
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,240
 

889
00:13:11,829 --> 00:13:14,649
 and you learn something called the

890
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,649
 

891
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,920
 quantity theory of money it's an

892
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,920
 

893
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:19,279
 identity that shows

894
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:19,279
 

895
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,880
 you times V equals P times y now what

896
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:19,880
 

897
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,410
 does that mean

898
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,410
 

899
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,990
 and there's amount of money in the money

900
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,990
 

901
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,880
 supply V is the velocity of money it's

902
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,880
 

903
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:27,800
 how much time money is spent in how many

904
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,800
 

905
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,839
 times money is spent and Reis pence in a

906
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,839
 

907
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,399
 given period of time P is the prices of

908
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:31,399
 

909
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,740
 everything and Y is the amount of stuff

910
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:33,740
 

911
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,949
 we're actually producing so P times y is

912
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,949
 

913
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:38,240
 the nominal GDP so this has this Kennedy

914
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,240
 

915
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,070
 says the amount of money that's out

916
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,070
 

917
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,180
 there times how many times people spend

918
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,180
 

919
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,310
 that money over and over again

920
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,310
 

921
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:45,199
 equals the nominal GDP now it's

922
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,199
 

923
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:47,060
 important because it shows you when you

924
00:13:45,189 --> 00:13:47,060
 

925
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,370
 increase the money supply and velocity

926
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,370
 

927
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,290
 stays the same and why the output stays

928
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,290
 

929
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:53,480
 the same you have an equivalent change

930
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,480
 

931
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:55,220
 in prices so if I know money supply goes

932
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,220
 

933
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,110
 up by ten percent price is gonna go up

934
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,110
 

935
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,760
 exactly by ten percent and the other two

936
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,760
 

937
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,769
 causes of inflation are actually super

938
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,769
 

939
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,839
 simple the first ones called demand pull

940
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:02,839
 

941
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:04,250
 this is the idea of demand goes up

942
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:04,250
 

943
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:05,870
 people want to buy a lot more stuff in

944
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,870
 

945
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,600
 your country and people put up the price

946
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,600
 

947
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:10,970
 for it so demand pulls up prices the

948
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,970
 

949
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,680
 other one is called cost push cost

950
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,680
 

951
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,260
 pushes the idea that there's some

952
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,260
 

953
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,570
 resource costs or you know we ran out of

954
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,570
 

955
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,029
 some key resource to produce stuff that

956
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,029
 

957
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:21,589
 cost the production costs to rice so now

958
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:21,589
 

959
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,140
 it costs more to produce stuff so we

960
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:24,140
 

961
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,350
 produce less stuff causing prices to go

962
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:24,350
 

963
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,180
 up

964
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,180
 

965
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,279
 so either demand goes up people want

966
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,279
 

967
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:30,350
 more stuff or you can't produce as much

968
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,350
 

969
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,630
 stuff either one causes prices to go up

970
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,630
 

971
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,399
 causes of inflation overall unit two is

972
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,399
 

973
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,649
 not that difficult I give it four out of

974
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,649
 

975
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,880
 ten difficulty but the concepts you

976
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,880
 

977
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:40,399
 actually have to know you have to

978
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,399
 

979
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,199
 understand the types of unemployment GDP

980
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:42,199
 

981
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,730
 I mean he's huge concepts that if you

982
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,730
 

983
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,709
 don't get these you're not gonna get

984
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,709
 

985
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,899
 future concepts at all now in unit three

986
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:47,899
 

987
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,279
 this where things get hard it's a bear

988
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:49,279
 

989
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:51,500
 of unit there's so much stuff you got to

990
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:51,500
 

991
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,630
 learn it starts off with the idea of a

992
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,630
 

993
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,160
 great demand aggregate demand is all the

994
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,160
 

995
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,899
 stuff that people want to buy in the

996
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,899
 

997
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,949
 economy at different price levels and

998
00:14:56,889 --> 00:14:57,949
 

999
00:14:56,899 --> 00:14:59,899
 it's kind of downward sloping demand

1000
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,899
 

1001
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:01,880
 curve just like a market demand curve

1002
00:14:59,889 --> 00:15:01,880
 

1003
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,589
 except now instead of price it's price

1004
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,589
 

1005
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,779
 level it's the price level and the

1006
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:05,779
 

1007
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:07,550
 quantity demanded of everything bought

1008
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,550
 

1009
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,990
 by everybody now this is downward

1010
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,990
 

1011
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,670
 sloping for three reasons you need to

1012
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,670
 

1013
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,470
 understand the three reasons first is

1014
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,470
 

1015
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,480
 the wealth effect the idea that when

1016
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,480
 

1017
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:16,339
 price level goes up the assets and

1018
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,339
 

1019
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,019
 people's banks are worth less right now

1020
00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:18,019
 

1021
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:20,149
 I can't buy as much as before

1022
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:20,149
 

1023
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:22,040
 and so when price level goes up people

1024
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,040
 

1025
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,240
 buy less stuff and the opposite as well

1026
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,240
 

1027
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,949
 price level goes down people buy more

1028
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,949
 

1029
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:26,779
 stuff there's also the interest rate

1030
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,779
 

1031
00:15:24,949 --> 00:15:28,250
 effect when inflation happens interest

1032
00:15:26,769 --> 00:15:28,250
 

1033
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:29,640
 rates tend to go up and so people would

1034
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,640
 

1035
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,350
 take out less loans again

1036
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,350
 

1037
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,760
 these are the reasons why that a great

1038
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,760
 

1039
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,710
 demand curve is downward-sloping

1040
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,710
 

1041
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,540
 the last reason is because the foreign

1042
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,540
 

1043
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,090
 trade effect this is the idea that when

1044
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,090
 

1045
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,200
 price level goes up people from other

1046
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,200
 

1047
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,930
 countries don't want to buy your stuff

1048
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,930
 

1049
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,400
 and so quite a bit again goes down just

1050
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,400
 

1051
00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,380
 like a market demand curve the aggregate

1052
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,380
 

1053
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,120
 man curve can shift and increases the

1054
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,120
 

1055
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,950
 right a decrease to left and the

1056
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,950
 

1057
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,810
 shifters are really simple anything that

1058
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,810
 

1059
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,670
 changes what people want to buy so if

1060
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,670
 

1061
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:55,200
 other countries or if there's more

1062
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,200
 

1063
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:56,970
 investment or if there's more consumer

1064
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,970
 

1065
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,290
 spending any of those things can shift

1066
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,290
 

1067
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,330
 the aggregate demand either right or

1068
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,330
 

1069
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:02,370
 left there's also an aggregate supply

1070
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,370
 

1071
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,000
 curve which is upward sloping in the

1072
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,000
 

1073
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,530
 short run

1074
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,530
 

1075
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,990
 that means when price level goes up

1076
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,990
 

1077
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:08,760
 producers want to produce more stuff but

1078
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,760
 

1079
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,100
 there's also a long-run graph this is

1080
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,100
 

1081
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,810
 the idea of you know in the long run

1082
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,810
 

1083
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,030
 will produce the same exact quantity

1084
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,030
 

1085
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:16,890
 that's the idea of full employment GDP

1086
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,890
 

1087
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:18,030
 and the long-run aggregate supply shows

1088
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,030
 

1089
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:20,520
 you there's no relationship between

1090
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,520
 

1091
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,380
 price level and the real GDP we're

1092
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,380
 

1093
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:24,210
 actually producing in the long run in

1094
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:24,210
 

1095
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:27,150
 other words when in the long run

1096
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,150
 

1097
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:28,410
 eventually prices will go up or down and

1098
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,410
 

1099
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:31,140
 we'll still produce the same s stuff

1100
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,140
 

1101
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,970
 that we did before in the long run now

1102
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,970
 

1103
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,670
 both the short run aggregate supply and

1104
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,670
 

1105
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:37,380
 the longer tech supply can shift the

1106
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,380
 

1107
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,790
 short-run of course shifts right if it's

1108
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:38,790
 

1109
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,590
 an increase a left of this decrease

1110
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,590
 

1111
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:42,380
 anything that affects producers here so

1112
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,380
 

1113
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,640
 price of resources can do this

1114
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,640
 

1115
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,680
 technology can do this some sort of

1116
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,680
 

1117
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,120
 government regulations or taxes or

1118
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,120
 

1119
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,130
 subsidies that affects a lot of

1120
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,130
 

1121
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,540
 producers that could ship the short max

1122
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,540
 

1123
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:53,190
 supply curve this is by far the most

1124
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,190
 

1125
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,260
 important graph need be able to draw

1126
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,260
 

1127
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,390
 showing full employment showing a

1128
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,390
 

1129
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,220
 recessionary gap is showing an

1130
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,220
 

1131
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:01,020
 inflationary gap this shows the same

1132
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,020
 

1133
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:02,730
 concept we saw in the last unit on the

1134
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,730
 

1135
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,840
 business cycle another key concept to

1136
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,840
 

1137
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,670
 watch out for is the idea of stagflation

1138
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,670
 

1139
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,470
 when Agri supply shifts to the left

1140
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,470
 

1141
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,209
 price level goes up quantity goes down

1142
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,209
 

1143
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,970
 and this is like the worst case scenario

1144
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,970
 

1145
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,650
 we have inflation and low output which

1146
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,650
 

1147
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,060
 is bad now another thing you have to be

1148
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,060
 

1149
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:17,160
 able to do here is show what happens in

1150
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,160
 

1151
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,900
 the long run in other words when there's

1152
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:18,900
 

1153
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,760
 an event that occurs how do you go from

1154
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,760
 

1155
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,890
 the short run back to the long run if

1156
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,890
 

1157
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,750
 consumers want more stuff Agata man goes

1158
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,750
 

1159
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:28,110
 up right that leads to an inflationary

1160
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,110
 

1161
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,360
 gap but in the long run wages will go up

1162
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,360
 

1163
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,890
 cost the firm's will go up and the short

1164
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,890
 

1165
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,320
 night supply will shift back to the left

1166
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,320
 

1167
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:36,390
 and put us back in the long run it goes

1168
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:36,390
 

1169
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,590
 the same way for recessionary gap assume

1170
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,590
 

1171
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,390
 the economy's at full employment

1172
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,390
 

1173
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:42,020
 if consumption goes down people buy less

1174
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,020
 

1175
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:43,880
 stuff we end up with a recessionary gap

1176
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,880
 

1177
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,890
 and what happens well if wages are

1178
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:45,890
 

1179
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,380
 flexible which is debatable if wages are

1180
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,380
 

1181
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,720
 flexible eventually prices will fall for

1182
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,720
 

1183
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,220
 resources wages will fall and then cost

1184
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,220
 

1185
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,320
 will fall for firms so firms can produce

1186
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:54,320
 

1187
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,900
 more Eiger supply shifts right boom

1188
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,900
 

1189
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,400
 right back to the long-run that's

1190
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,400
 

1191
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,260
 creating the long-run aggregate supply

1192
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:00,260
 

1193
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,880
 curve that long-run adjustment is

1194
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,880
 

1195
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:05,240
 different than economic growth economic

1196
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,240
 

1197
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,070
 growth is the idea of GDP going up in

1198
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,070
 

1199
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,230
 the long run other words when there's an

1200
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,230
 

1201
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:10,730
 increase in investment there'd be more

1202
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,730
 

1203
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:12,290
 capital so a great demand will shift to

1204
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,290
 

1205
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:14,000
 the right and since we can produce more

1206
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,000
 

1207
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,370
 stuff short black supply would shift the

1208
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,370
 

1209
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
 right and the long-run Agra supply would

1210
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,080
 

1211
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,980
 also shift to the right and you've seen

1212
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,980
 

1213
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,840
 this before with the production

1214
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:20,840
 

1215
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,920
 possibilities curve the production

1216
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,920
 

1217
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,690
 possibilities curve shifting to the

1218
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,690
 

1219
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,250
 right is like the long-run aggregate

1220
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,250
 

1221
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:26,600
 supply curve shift ins right we can

1222
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,600
 

1223
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,100
 produce more stuff that we couldn't

1224
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,100
 

1225
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,330
 produce before that's economic growth

1226
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,330
 

1227
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,370
 before you get too excited that you can

1228
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,370
 

1229
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,020
 draw the concepts on one graph keep in

1230
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,020
 

1231
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,210
 mind there's another graph if the bills

1232
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:35,210
 

1233
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:37,190
 show recessionary gap inflationary gap

1234
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,190
 

1235
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:38,420
 in a full employment it's called the

1236
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:38,420
 

1237
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,530
 phillips curve the phillips curve shows

1238
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:39,530
 

1239
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,809
 the relationship between inflation and

1240
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,809
 

1241
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,250
 unemployment in the short-run there's a

1242
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:43,250
 

1243
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:44,300
 downward sloping relationship in other

1244
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,300
 

1245
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,740
 words a negative relationship between

1246
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,740
 

1247
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:47,300
 these two things either you get a high

1248
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,300
 

1249
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:48,650
 inflation or you know high unemployment

1250
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:48,650
 

1251
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,660
 but you usually don't have them at the

1252
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,660
 

1253
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,429
 same time and in the long run its

1254
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,429
 

1255
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,410
 vertical there's no relationship between

1256
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,410
 

1257
00:18:52,429 --> 00:18:55,910
 inflation and unemployment in the long

1258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,910
 

1259
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,140
 run so with these two graphs you should

1260
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,140
 

1261
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,880
 be able to show when the economy's at

1262
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:58,880
 

1263
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,830
 full employment when has an inflationary

1264
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,830
 

1265
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,960
 gap when it has a recessionary gap or

1266
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,960
 

1267
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,059
 when there's a shift in the short-run at

1268
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,059
 

1269
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,100
 supply curve and how that shifts these

1270
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,100
 

1271
00:19:05,059 --> 00:19:08,030
 short run Phillips curve the next thing

1272
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,030
 

1273
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,290
 you're gonna learn in this unit is the

1274
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,290
 

1275
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,970
 idea of fiscal policy which is the

1276
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,970
 

1277
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,260
 change in government spending and taxes

1278
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,260
 

1279
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,270
 when the economy is doing poorly

1280
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,270
 

1281
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,740
 how do we fix the economy expansion airy

1282
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,740
 

1283
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,179
 fiscal policy is when we increase

1284
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,179
 

1285
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,470
 government spending or cut taxes and

1286
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:18,470
 

1287
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:21,170
 there's contractionary fiscal policy

1288
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,170
 

1289
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,460
 where you increase taxes or decrease

1290
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,460
 

1291
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,630
 government spending and we're the last

1292
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:23,630
 

1293
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,030
 concepts you're going to see is the

1294
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,030
 

1295
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,980
 spending multiplier spending multipliers

1296
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,980
 

1297
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,990
 the idea when people spend that become

1298
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,990
 

1299
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,700
 somebody else's income and then people

1300
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,700
 

1301
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,110
 save a portion of that and they spend

1302
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:33,110
 

1303
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,550
 the rest and that's spending become

1304
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,550
 

1305
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,410
 somebody else as income keeps happening

1306
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,410
 

1307
00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:37,580
 over and over again you understand the

1308
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,580
 

1309
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,020
 idea of the marginal propensity to

1310
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:39,020
 

1311
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,780
 consume which shows you how much people

1312
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,780
 

1313
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,340
 consume of new income and then there's

1314
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,340
 

1315
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,380
 much plenty to say which is the opposite

1316
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:45,380
 

1317
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:47,690
 side how much people save of new income

1318
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,690
 

1319
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:49,640
 simple spending multiplier is won over

1320
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,640
 

1321
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,280
 the marginal propensity to save which

1322
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:52,280
 

1323
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:53,840
 means this is if initial change in

1324
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,840
 

1325
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,429
 spending happens that's going to get

1326
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,429
 

1327
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,779
 multiplied by this amount and

1328
00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:56,779
 

1329
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,580
 the total change in spending after

1330
00:19:56,769 --> 00:19:58,580
 

1331
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,570
 people spending saves Benna save what

1332
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,570
 

1333
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,460
 happens over and over and over again

1334
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,460
 

1335
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,139
 right there's also a tax multiplier

1336
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,139
 

1337
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,759
 which is one less than the spending

1338
00:20:03,129 --> 00:20:04,759
 

1339
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:05,960
 multiplier and then the math isn't super

1340
00:20:04,749 --> 00:20:05,960
 

1341
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,059
 difficult it's just something at the

1342
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,059
 

1343
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,830
 practice to get comfortable with the

1344
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:09,830
 

1345
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:12,049
 last thing in this unit is the idea of

1346
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,049
 

1347
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,210
 the debts the problems of fiscal policy

1348
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:14,210
 

1349
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:15,499
 right increasing government spending and

1350
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,499
 

1351
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,239
 lowering taxes seems like a good idea

1352
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,239
 

1353
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:19,129
 but you're gonna have to deficit spend

1354
00:20:17,229 --> 00:20:19,129
 

1355
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,119
 which is spend more than you bring in in

1356
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,119
 

1357
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:22,070
 tax revenue so the government's gonna

1358
00:20:20,109 --> 00:20:22,070
 

1359
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,289
 spend more than they bring in and tax

1360
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,289
 

1361
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:26,359
 revenue means they have to go into debt

1362
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,359
 

1363
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:27,889
 or they have to have a deficit for that

1364
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:27,889
 

1365
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,719
 given year now the debt is the

1366
00:20:27,879 --> 00:20:29,719
 

1367
00:20:27,889 --> 00:20:30,859
 accumulation of all the deficits the

1368
00:20:29,709 --> 00:20:30,859
 

1369
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:33,409
 deficit is amount that they're

1370
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:33,409
 

1371
00:20:30,859 --> 00:20:34,609
 overspending in that given year and you

1372
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:34,609
 

1373
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:35,869
 should understand this idea of crowding

1374
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,869
 

1375
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,940
 out when the government does a lot of

1376
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,940
 

1377
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:40,009
 borrowing that increases interest rates

1378
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,009
 

1379
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,659
 and kind of crowds out investors and

1380
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:41,659
 

1381
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:43,190
 consumers from taking out loans and

1382
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:43,190
 

1383
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,839
 buying more stuff now this unit I'm

1384
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,839
 

1385
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:46,759
 gonna give eight out of ten difficulty

1386
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:46,759
 

1387
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:48,619
 because it has a bunch of key grass a

1388
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:48,619
 

1389
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,269
 bunch of key concepts maybe get slowed

1390
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:50,269
 

1391
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,889
 down we talked about the multiplier but

1392
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:51,889
 

1393
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:53,749
 none of it's like super impossible hard

1394
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,749
 

1395
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:56,239
 but it's a lot of stuff going on it's

1396
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,239
 

1397
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:57,529
 the bulk of a macro economics class okay

1398
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:57,529
 

1399
00:20:56,239 --> 00:20:58,820
 here we go we're talking about money it

1400
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:58,820
 

1401
00:20:57,529 --> 00:21:00,799
 starts off by talking about what money

1402
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,799
 

1403
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:02,210
 is it's a mean of exchange and why it's

1404
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:02,210
 

1405
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,919
 better than the barter system then you

1406
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,919
 

1407
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:05,899
 talk about commodity money and fiat

1408
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,899
 

1409
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,669
 money commodity money has some sort of

1410
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,669
 

1411
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:09,499
 intrinsic value fiat money does not and

1412
00:21:07,659 --> 00:21:09,499
 

1413
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:11,659
 the three functions of money there are

1414
00:21:09,489 --> 00:21:11,659
 

1415
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:13,700
 the medium of exchange Univ account and

1416
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,700
 

1417
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:15,739
 a store of value the next in you talking

1418
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,739
 

1419
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,940
 about is m1 money supply so we talk

1420
00:21:15,729 --> 00:21:16,940
 

1421
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,989
 about money in this class we're not just

1422
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,989
 

1423
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,389
 talking about money and currency and

1424
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:20,389
 

1425
00:21:17,989 --> 00:21:22,129
 cash we're talking about money in people

1426
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,129
 

1427
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:23,899
 checking accounts so demand deposits as

1428
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,899
 

1429
00:21:22,129 --> 00:21:25,940
 well also understand the idea of the

1430
00:21:23,889 --> 00:21:25,940
 

1431
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:27,679
 fractional reserve banking the idea that

1432
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,679
 

1433
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,869
 banks hold a portion of reserves and

1434
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:29,869
 

1435
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,820
 they loan out the rest the money that

1436
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:31,820
 

1437
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:32,989
 ends up you know being spent by somebody

1438
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,989
 

1439
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,580
 and that ends up in another bank and

1440
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:34,580
 

1441
00:21:32,989 --> 00:21:36,139
 that other bank holds a portion that

1442
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,139
 

1443
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,820
 money in loans the rest of it Out's

1444
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:37,820
 

1445
00:21:36,139 --> 00:21:39,679
 you also understand the idea of bank

1446
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,679
 

1447
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,719
 balance sheets bank balance sheet shows

1448
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:41,719
 

1449
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,369
 the assets and liabilities for a given

1450
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,369
 

1451
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:45,589
 bank you should be able to use this to

1452
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,589
 

1453
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:48,259
 calculate the required reserve ratio the

1454
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:48,259
 

1455
00:21:45,589 --> 00:21:49,999
 excess reserves required reserves is the

1456
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:49,999
 

1457
00:21:48,259 --> 00:21:50,659
 amount of money that a bank has to hold

1458
00:21:49,989 --> 00:21:50,659
 

1459
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:52,339
 by law

1460
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:52,339
 

1461
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:54,080
 excess reserves there's not money they

1462
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:54,080
 

1463
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,099
 can loan out if they want to at this

1464
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,099
 

1465
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,690
 point you're also going to learn about

1466
00:21:55,089 --> 00:21:56,690
 

1467
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:58,969
 the money multiplier we learned about

1468
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,969
 

1469
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,769
 the spending multiplier in unit 3 now

1470
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,769
 

1471
00:21:58,969 --> 00:22:02,179
 it's the same idea except talking about

1472
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,179
 

1473
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:04,399
 spending and you know consuming and

1474
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:04,399
 

1475
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:06,079
 saving or talked about banks lending so

1476
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,079
 

1477
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,519
 when a bank lends money someone takes

1478
00:22:06,069 --> 00:22:07,519
 

1479
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,050
 the money spends it ends up in another

1480
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,050
 

1481
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,790
 Bank

1482
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,790
 

1483
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,410
 that bank holds a portion and then loans

1484
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,410
 

1485
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,180
 the rest out that keeps happening over

1486
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,180
 

1487
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,410
 and over and over again the multiplier

1488
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,410
 

1489
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,210
 for the money multiplier is right here

1490
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,210
 

1491
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:18,100
 one over the reserve requirement

1492
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,100
 

1493
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,080
 remember the spending multiplier was one

1494
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,080
 

1495
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,970
 over the marginal pensee to save the

1496
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,970
 

1497
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,070
 money multiplier one over the reserve

1498
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,070
 

1499
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,230
 requirement same concept though the

1500
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,230
 

1501
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,690
 initial change in money supply times

1502
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,690
 

1503
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:30,610
 multiplier shows you the total change in

1504
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,610
 

1505
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,260
 the money supply key graph in this unit

1506
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,260
 

1507
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,450
 is the money market graph it shows a

1508
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:34,450
 

1509
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,890
 supply and demand for money

1510
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,890
 

1511
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:37,120
 you've got interest rates you got the

1512
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,120
 

1513
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:38,920
 quantity money it's got a downward

1514
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,920
 

1515
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,420
 sloping demand demand for money it

1516
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,420
 

1517
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,670
 happens for two reasons transaction

1518
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,670
 

1519
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,870
 demand and asset demand people need you

1520
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,870
 

1521
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:45,640
 know money to buy stuff and they need

1522
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,640
 

1523
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,680
 money or they like to have their assets

1524
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,680
 

1525
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,120
 and money as opposed to have their

1526
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,120
 

1527
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:51,070
 assets and bonds or stocks or something

1528
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,070
 

1529
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,500
 that's not money so there's a demand for

1530
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,500
 

1531
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:55,360
 money the supply is vertical it's set by

1532
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,360
 

1533
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:57,430
 the Fed and that comes together and sets

1534
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,430
 

1535
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,140
 the nominal interest rate now the Fed

1536
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,140
 

1537
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,940
 can control that money supply they could

1538
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,940
 

1539
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,290
 increase it shift to the right and they

1540
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,290
 

1541
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,000
 lower the interest rate or they can

1542
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,000
 

1543
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,050
 decrease it shift it to the left and

1544
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,050
 

1545
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,100
 they can increase the interest rate

1546
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,100
 

1547
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,840
 that's called

1548
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,840
 

1549
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,150
 monetary policy remember the Fed

1550
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,150
 

1551
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,490
 controls money supply if they increase

1552
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,490
 

1553
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:14,050
 the money supply lowers interest rates

1554
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,050
 

1555
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:15,790
 which would increase investment and

1556
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,790
 

1557
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,560
 consumer spending people take out more

1558
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,560
 

1559
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:18,190
 loans buy more stuff it would increase

1560
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,190
 

1561
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,260
 aggregate

1562
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,260
 

1563
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,330
 that's called expansionary monetary

1564
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,330
 

1565
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,800
 policy if the Fed were decreasing the

1566
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,800
 

1567
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:25,870
 money supply that would increase

1568
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,870
 

1569
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,370
 interest rates decrease investment

1570
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,370
 

1571
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,570
 decrease consumer spending people take

1572
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,570
 

1573
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,370
 out less loans because it's more

1574
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,370
 

1575
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,810
 expensive to pay back the loan and that

1576
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,810
 

1577
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,970
 would decrease the higher demand that's

1578
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,970
 

1579
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,590
 called contractionary monetary policy

1580
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,590
 

1581
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,180
 but understanding that is not enough you

1582
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,180
 

1583
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,860
 have to understand how they shift the

1584
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,860
 

1585
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,990
 money supply there's three shifters

1586
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,990
 

1587
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,760
 reserve requirement the discount rate

1588
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,760
 

1589
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:44,620
 and open market operations the reserve

1590
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,620
 

1591
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,720
 requirement the Fed can decide to choose

1592
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:46,720
 

1593
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,850
 whether to increase or decrease the

1594
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,850
 

1595
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,550
 amount that banks have to hold discount

1596
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,550
 

1597
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,930
 rate is how much banks are charged by

1598
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,930
 

1599
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:55,240
 the Fed when they borrow money from the

1600
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,240
 

1601
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,700
 Fed and then open micro operations when

1602
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,700
 

1603
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,770
 the Fed buys or sells bonds here's the

1604
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,770
 

1605
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,820
 rules you gonna watch out for it shows

1606
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,820
 

1607
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,200
 you what happens when the reserve

1608
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,200
 

1609
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,850
 requirement goes up or down discount

1610
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,850
 

1611
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,590
 rate goes up or down and then the Fed

1612
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,590
 

1613
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,720
 buys or sells bonds to the money supply

1614
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,720
 

1615
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,130
 so make sure you memorize this you got

1616
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,130
 

1617
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,080
 to know this that right there is

1618
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,080
 

1619
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:12,730
 monetary policy keep in mind there's a

1620
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,730
 

1621
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,890
 difference between the discount rate is

1622
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,890
 

1623
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:16,930
 what the Fed charges banks and the

1624
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,930
 

1625
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:19,420
 federal funds rate is what banks charge

1626
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,420
 

1627
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:21,410
 each other so if a bank needs money they

1628
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,410
 

1629
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,730
 can either go they first they can go

1630
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,730
 

1631
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,320
 to the people they know lent the money

1632
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,320
 

1633
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,030
 to and say I will need the money back

1634
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:26,030
 

1635
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,800
 that's one option or they can go to

1636
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,800
 

1637
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,600
 another bank or the may and go to the

1638
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,600
 

1639
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,590
 Fed so when they go to the Fed that's a

1640
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,590
 

1641
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,090
 discount rate that's what they're

1642
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,090
 

1643
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,470
 charged they go to another bank that's

1644
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,470
 

1645
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,450
 called the federal funds rate the names

1646
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,450
 

1647
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,040
 horrible they should be reversed right

1648
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,040
 

1649
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:39,590
 but just remember if federal funds rate

1650
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:39,590
 

1651
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,940
 is what banks charge other banks the

1652
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,940
 

1653
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,010
 next concept you have to understand is

1654
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:43,010
 

1655
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,600
 the idea of loanable funds loanable

1656
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,600
 

1657
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,540
 funds is another key graph that shows a

1658
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,540
 

1659
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,640
 demand and the supply of loans the

1660
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:49,640
 

1661
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,470
 demand for loans is by borrowers you the

1662
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,470
 

1663
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:53,480
 people who want to borrow money the

1664
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,480
 

1665
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,250
 supply is by lenders all the people who

1666
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:55,250
 

1667
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,710
 want to lend out money and it gives you

1668
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,710
 

1669
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:59,240
 the real interest rate now this curve of

1670
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,240
 

1671
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,370
 course can shift both supply or demand

1672
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:01,370
 

1673
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:03,560
 for example the government does a lot of

1674
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,560
 

1675
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:04,880
 borrowing that increases the demand for

1676
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,880
 

1677
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,920
 loans because the Khmers say i want to

1678
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,920
 

1679
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,210
 borrow some that and again interest

1680
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,210
 

1681
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,010
 rates go out then the graph shows you

1682
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,010
 

1683
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,690
 the concept of crowding out which I

1684
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,690
 

1685
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:13,820
 talked about earlier if the government

1686
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,820
 

1687
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:16,370
 deficits bends they demand more money

1688
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:16,370
 

1689
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:18,020
 that increases demand for loans higher

1690
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,020
 

1691
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:21,260
 interest rate higher real estate means

1692
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:21,260
 

1693
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,610
 less investment and less consumption of

1694
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:22,610
 

1695
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,440
 you know things that people would pick

1696
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,440
 

1697
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,090
 out loans for so overall unit four is

1698
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,090
 

1699
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,560
 pretty hard I give it eight out of ten

1700
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,560
 

1701
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,300
 difficulty because it has some graphs

1702
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,300
 

1703
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,200
 and it has some calculation so as to

1704
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,200
 

1705
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,850
 bring a lot of different concepts

1706
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,850
 

1707
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,160
 together but it's all talking about one

1708
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,160
 

1709
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:35,810
 big concept monetary policy if you get

1710
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,810
 

1711
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,160
 that you're gonna be fine now for the

1712
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,160
 

1713
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:38,900
 last unit we talked about international

1714
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,900
 

1715
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,700
 trade and foreign exchange it's gonna

1716
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,700
 

1717
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,710
 start off the balance of payments this

1718
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,710
 

1719
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,450
 shows all the transactions between

1720
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,450
 

1721
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,040
 different countries it has two different

1722
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,040
 

1723
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,990
 accounts the current accounts and the

1724
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,990
 

1725
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,120
 financial account the current account is

1726
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,120
 

1727
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:51,470
 made up of first the balance of trade

1728
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,470
 

1729
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,140
 that's the first idea on understand

1730
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,140
 

1731
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,910
 exports and imports if you export more

1732
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,910
 

1733
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:58,070
 than you import then you have a trade

1734
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,070
 

1735
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:00,260
 surplus if you import more than you

1736
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,260
 

1737
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:01,790
 export you've a trade deficit so the

1738
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,790
 

1739
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,740
 first part that you need to understand

1740
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,740
 

1741
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:06,020
 is the goods and services that are sold

1742
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:06,020
 

1743
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,090
 are sold and kept track of in the

1744
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:08,090
 

1745
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,920
 current account now investment income is

1746
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,920
 

1747
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,710
 also counted in the current account and

1748
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,710
 

1749
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,750
 so is net transfers when one country you

1750
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,750
 

1751
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,580
 know gives aid to another country or

1752
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,580
 

1753
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,170
 remittance when one person in one

1754
00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:18,170
 

1755
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,120
 country lives there they send money back

1756
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,120
 

1757
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,920
 to their family these things all count

1758
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,920
 

1759
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,230
 in the current account the financial

1760
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,230
 

1761
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,840
 account is basically financial assets it

1762
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,840
 

1763
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,060
 shows inflow and outflow of money coming

1764
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:29,060
 

1765
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,560
 in or out of a country now if the inflow

1766
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,560
 

1767
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,510
 into your country is greater than the

1768
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,510
 

1769
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,640
 outflow that means you have a surplus in

1770
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,640
 

1771
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:37,530
 financial account if outflow is more

1772
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,530
 

1773
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:39,450
 than the inflow then you have a deficit

1774
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,450
 

1775
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:42,120
 in the financial account now keep in

1776
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,120
 

1777
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:43,920
 mind when a country has a deficit in the

1778
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,920
 

1779
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:46,260
 current account that means they have to

1780
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:46,260
 

1781
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,550
 have a surplus in the financial account

1782
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,550
 

1783
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,080
 that's why it's got the balance of

1784
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,080
 

1785
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,730
 payment the next times that you're gonna

1786
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,730
 

1787
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,410
 learn is the big concept in this unit

1788
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,410
 

1789
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,420
 foreign exchange it talks about the

1790
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,420
 

1791
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,010
 relative value of currencies to each

1792
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,010
 

1793
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:57,570
 other now the first thing I understand

1794
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,570
 

1795
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:59,280
 is the idea of appreciation of this is

1796
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,280
 

1797
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,860
 the idea that a country's currency

1798
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:01,860
 

1799
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,570
 increases in value relative to other

1800
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,570
 

1801
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,280
 countries currency and the opposite is

1802
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,280
 

1803
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:06,360
 the idea of depreciation now keep in

1804
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,360
 

1805
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,550
 mind the relationship between

1806
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,550
 

1807
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,080
 appreciation depreciation and net

1808
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,080
 

1809
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,210
 exports when your current country's

1810
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,210
 

1811
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,850
 currency appreciates that's gonna cause

1812
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,850
 

1813
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:16,080
 your net exports of that country to fall

1814
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,080
 

1815
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,820
 people can buy less your stuff because

1816
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,820
 

1817
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,130
 it's more expensive to buy your stuff

1818
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:20,130
 

1819
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,440
 when your currency depreciates that's

1820
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,440
 

1821
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:24,450
 gonna cause the net exports to go up so

1822
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,450
 

1823
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,130
 don't get confusing all depreciation is

1824
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,130
 

1825
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:27,840
 a bad thing it's not it's actually great

1826
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,840
 

1827
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,090
 if you're an exporter it's bad if you're

1828
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,090
 

1829
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,100
 an importer also understand that there's

1830
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,100
 

1831
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:34,340
 a graph here it looks like this this

1832
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:34,340
 

1833
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,260
 shows you the supply and demand for

1834
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:37,260
 

1835
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,210
 dollars relative to euros so be able to

1836
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,210
 

1837
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,760
 draw the demand supply keep in mind the

1838
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,760
 

1839
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:43,650
 demand is buy because we're analyzing

1840
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,650
 

1841
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,170
 dollars here the demand is by Europeans

1842
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,170
 

1843
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:48,330
 and the supply is by Americans also

1844
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,330
 

1845
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:49,950
 understand that when there's a change in

1846
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,950
 

1847
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:51,480
 one market there's a change in a

1848
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,480
 

1849
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,460
 corresponding other market in other

1850
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,460
 

1851
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,620
 words this is the man for dollars and

1852
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:55,620
 

1853
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:57,750
 the supply for dollars there's also the

1854
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:57,750
 

1855
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:00,090
 supply and demand for euros and it's the

1856
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,090
 

1857
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,010
 exchange rate so for example Europeans

1858
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,010
 

1859
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,660
 want to go on vacation in the United

1860
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,660
 

1861
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:05,880
 States they need more American dollars

1862
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,880
 

1863
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,560
 so the demand for dollars increases and

1864
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,560
 

1865
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,960
 the dollar is going to appreciate

1866
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,960
 

1867
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,630
 relative to the euro but at the same

1868
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,630
 

1869
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:15,060
 time Europeans are going to supply more

1870
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,060
 

1871
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:17,130
 of their euros that causes the euro to

1872
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:17,130
 

1873
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:18,780
 depreciate so keep in mind for any graph

1874
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,780
 

1875
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,370
 there's also a phantom graph that goes

1876
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,370
 

1877
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:22,590
 along with it and the rule is when

1878
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,590
 

1879
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:25,440
 demand goes up for one the other country

1880
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,440
 

1881
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:27,180
 has to supply more of theirs also there

1882
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,180
 

1883
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,710
 are four shifters of foreign exchange

1884
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,710
 

1885
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:30,540
 the first one is the one we just did

1886
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,540
 

1887
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,640
 tastes and preferences of people prefer

1888
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,640
 

1889
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,660
 more things from one country then

1890
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,660
 

1891
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,520
 they're gonna demand more of that

1892
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,520
 

1893
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,540
 currency so they can go buy it so that

1894
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,540
 

1895
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,220
 will cause that currency to appreciate

1896
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,220
 

1897
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,320
 so tastes the premise is really easy

1898
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,320
 

1899
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:41,850
 next one is income if a country is

1900
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,850
 

1901
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,620
 richer they buy more things including

1902
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,620
 

1903
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:45,450
 things from other countries then there's

1904
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:45,450
 

1905
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,630
 inflation so if price level goes with my

1906
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,630
 

1907
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,010
 country I don't want to

1908
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,010
 

1909
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,870
 stuff in my country more at this higher

1910
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,870
 

1911
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,640
 price I go by other country stuff and

1912
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,640
 

1913
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:53,230
 last one is interest rates which gets

1914
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,230
 

1915
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,790
 tricky interest rates are now the

1916
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,790
 

1917
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:57,010
 opposite of what you'd normally thoughts

1918
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,010
 

1919
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:59,080
 all the way back in unit 3 and unit 4

1920
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,080
 

1921
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,580
 now we talk about interest rates we're

1922
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,580
 

1923
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,990
 saying that interest is a good thing

1924
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,990
 

1925
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:03,790
 right in other words interest rates

1926
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,790
 

1927
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,860
 higher interest rates will bring in more

1928
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,860
 

1929
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:07,540
 inflow in your country because other

1930
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,540
 

1931
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,670
 countries want to get the higher rate of

1932
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,670
 

1933
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,530
 return keep in mind two currencies can't

1934
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,530
 

1935
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:13,210
 appreciate relative to each other at the

1936
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,210
 

1937
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:15,190
 same time so the dollar can't appreciate

1938
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,190
 

1939
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,650
 relative to the euro as the euro

1940
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,650
 

1941
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:19,570
 appreciates relative dollar one goes up

1942
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,570
 

1943
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,220
 and the other one has to go down last

1944
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,220
 

1945
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:23,530
 thing here is the idea of floating and

1946
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,530
 

1947
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,060
 it's a fixed exchange rates floating

1948
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,060
 

1949
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:28,030
 exchange rates allow supply and demand

1950
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:28,030
 

1951
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,560
 to set the exchange rate a fixed

1952
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,560
 

1953
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:31,330
 exchange rate is when the government of

1954
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,330
 

1955
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,580
 the country tries to manipulate their

1956
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,580
 

1957
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:35,620
 currency to keep it fixed or pegged to

1958
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,620
 

1959
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:37,150
 another country's currency now unit 5 is

1960
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:37,150
 

1961
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,980
 super short and it doesn't have a lot of

1962
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,980
 

1963
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,690
 graphs but I give it a six out of ten

1964
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:40,690
 

1965
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,160
 difficulty because it's just so darn

1966
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
 

1967
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:43,810
 important you have to understand how to

1968
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:43,810
 

1969
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,580
 get exchange rates and don't get it

1970
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,580
 

1971
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:47,440
 tripped up when you're analyzing two

1972
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,440
 

1973
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,450
 different countries and whether the

1974
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:49,450
 

1975
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,500
 currency appreciates or depreciates hey

1976
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,500
 

1977
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:52,300
 thank you so much for watching this

1978
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:52,300
 

1979
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,910
 video I wish you all the best of luck on

1980
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,910
 

1981
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,320
